# Reports

In this folder, we will store old pentest reports after any laid out vulnerabilities are patched. Regardless of patch status, these reports can and will be redacted to the point Security Archive deems necessary. These reports will never make client information public unless authorized by the client's main contact. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, you can view our privacy policy at https://securityarchive.net/privacy or contact info@securityarchive.net.
