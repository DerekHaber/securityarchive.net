# Functionality of Security Archive

The Security Archive Project has a lot of backend workings that a random visitor may not get to see. Here I lay it out.

## Registration

We all can see the login and registration forms, so to keep it quick, I'll just point out the encryption of passwords. To keep your information secure in the event of a leak or breach, nobody has access to reading your password.
We store your password in an encrypted state, and there is never a moment it would be visible in plaintext.
